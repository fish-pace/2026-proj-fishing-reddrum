## Project Name

Red Drum habitat: Fish distribution and investigation into environmental drivers using PACE

**One-line Description:** Use PACE data to infer drivers of red drum habitat

**Goal:** Map red drum tag data with PACE variables

* Slack Channel: **proj-fishdrum**
* Pitch Slide: [Project 5 Fishery productivity, marine animal habitat: their distribution and their drivers](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12q0pR__0EPRSHUYNb3KnKEOb08HT4t3K/edit?slide=id.g3b8a1a82a8e_0_195#slide=id.g3b8a1a82a8e_0_195)
* Final presentation: [Red Drum habitat: Fish distribution and investigation into environmental drivers using PACE
](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SemE7DAEMcQuHGXWQbS1p2MyZq411kaqfdzp4s4hTA4/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p)

**Folder Structure**

* `contributor_folders` (optional) Each contributor can make a folder here and 
push their work here during the week. This will allow everyone to see each others work but prevent any merge conflicts.
  + **Retno:** Matchup red drum with Level 2 AOP and BGC
  + **Ayeshmantha:** Level 3 weekly chlorophyll maps
* `final_notebooks` When the team develops shared final notebooks, they 
can be shared here. Make sure to communicate so that you limit merge conflicts.
* `scripts` Shared scripts or functions can be added here.
* `data` Shared dataset can be shared here. Note, do not put large datasets on GitHub. Speak to the organizers if you 
need to share large datasets.

## Datasets

We are using Red Drum acoustic tag data. The data are weekly averaged pings at the acoustic receivers for 12 individual red drum fish. The primary location of the receivers is Chesapeake Bay but a few are outside of Chesapeake Bay.

## Workflow/Roadmap

**Tuesday**
1. Set up GitHub repo - Ted
2. Edit Readme - Ron
3. Look at the code for L2 - Jeniffer, Retno
4. Downloading L3 data - Ted, Ayeshmantha
5. Make reddrum tag data available thru FTP - Ron

**Wednesday**
1. Ayeshmantha: Add fish locations to weekly L3 chl maps
2. Retno: Add AVW to granule-averaged L2 BGC maps and show fish locations subsetted for averaging window
3. Retno: Output L2 AVW and BGC averaged for fish location as CSV file (by week)
4. Jeniffer: Create statistical analyses using Retno's AVW,BGC CSV file
5. Ted: Create temperature maps (similar to Ayeshmantha's?)
6. Ron: Document the project, update Readme, start final presentation

**Thursday**
