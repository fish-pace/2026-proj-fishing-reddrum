# 2026-proj-fishing-reddrum

**Goal:** Map red drum tag data with PACE variables
* Slack Channel: **proj-fishdrum**
* Pitch Slide: [Project 5 Fishery productivity, marine animal habitat: their distribution and their drivers](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12q0pR__0EPRSHUYNb3KnKEOb08HT4t3K/edit?slide=id.g3b8a1a82a8e_0_195#slide=id.g3b8a1a82a8e_0_195)
* Final presentation: Add link

**Folder Structure**

* `contributor_folders` (optional) Each contributor can make a folder here and 
push their work here during the week. This will allow everyone to see each others work but prevent any merge conflicts.
* `final_notebooks` When the team develops shared final notebooks, they 
can be shared here. Make sure to communicate so that you limit merge conflicts.
* `scripts` Shared scripts or functions can be added here.
* `data` Shared dataset can be shared here. Note, do not put large datasets on GitHub. Speak to the organizers if you 
need to share large datasets.
